# Collaboration and Contribution

To make things completely seemless for we all and to also make collaboration more efficient. We've extended our collaboration to GitHub from Slack. It's important that we also learn the use of GitHub and how-to GitHub efficiently for project collaboration. 

## Get started:

The most important thing! Please update the README.md with your name in collaborator section at bottom of this docs. Once that's done the team lead will add you to their team and to the org. 

##### For Developer
- Kindly star the project :wink:
- Open an issue for a feature or a change you'd love to work on (please, ensure that someone is not working on it by checking previous issues. Whereby an issue already exist, please still go ahead with the steps below and help the collaborator finish up the feature or changes)
- Fork the repo 
- Make your changes 
- Push and create a PR
- Get approvals from other collaborators (if successful, your code gets merged)
- Congratulations

##### For Designers: 
- Kindly star the project 
- Open an issue, drop the link to the design (and maybe a screenshot) in the issue 
- Get reviews from other collaborators (if they love it)
- Move forward with a PR in designs folder 
- Get merged and the design officially becomes the design for the project.'

That will be lots of issue. Yea! true, but this provide a public archive to help track progress and how things will be over the next few months. Good Luck Developers! Happy Hacking!
